# Advent-Of-Code-2021
- My solutions to the programming puzzles from https://adventofcode.com.
- For puzzles with multiple parts, please check the commit history of the solution directory (e.g. day-4) you are interested in to view the code state for each of its parts (e.g., the latest code for day-4 solves its second part, but to see the code for its first part please find the commit with the message "Complete part 1 of day 4: giant squid").
