# Advent-Of-Code-2021
- My solutions to the programming puzzles from https://adventofcode.com.
- For puzzles with multiple parts, please check the commit history of the solution directory (e.g. day-4) you are interested in to view the code state for each part (e.g., commit message with "Complete part 1 of day 4: giant squid").
